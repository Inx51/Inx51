# Hello ðŸ‘‹!


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on howlite-resources
---
For a long time, Iâ€™ve had a dream of being able to quickly prototype APIs and applications without first having to define strongly typed API endpoints with a predefined data structure. With howlite-resources, I can spin up a container and use simple, common HTTP methods to create, read, update, and delete resourcesâ€”without going through the whole "data-type ceremony" first. This lets me prototype quickly, fail fast, and iterate faster.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang
---
The howlite-resources project has gone through multiple iterations over the years, most of them built with C# and .NET, since thatâ€™s my "native tongue" in programming. However, after a short proof of concept, I noticed that Golang handles this kind of application much better in terms of performance, so I decided to take that path.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on whatever might be interesting
---
Right now, Iâ€™d especially love to work with others on building an open-source framework for .NET with a focus on messaging.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with feedback
---
Iâ€™d love to hear feedback on howlite-resources from more experienced Golang developers.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about .NET or C#
---
Thatâ€™s my turf!
