# Hello 👋!

👷 I’m a software engineer by profession
---
During my work hours, I focus on making decisions that won’t cause trouble in the long run—avoiding technical debt and poor early choices. I like tinkering with different ideas and exploring solutions that balance the best outcome with the money and time available.

With a long background in .NET development, I still spend plenty of time programming. I strongly believe in the principle of “you build it, you run it”, which for me includes taking responsibility for the entire process—from design and development to deployment and operations.

🏡 Father and husband
---
I’m happily married, and together with my wife we’re raising a wonderful kid who brightens my days.

👾 Gamer
---
I truly enjoy a good game—whether it’s diving into a great story, sharing laughs with friends, or feeling the thrill of competition.

🔭 Working on howlite-resources
---
For a long time, I’ve had a dream of being able to quickly prototype APIs and applications without first having to define strongly typed API endpoints with a predefined data structure. With howlite-resources, I can spin up a container and use simple, common HTTP methods to create, read, update, and delete resources—without going through the whole "data-type ceremony" first. This lets me prototype quickly, fail fast, and iterate faster.

🌱 Currently learning

## Golang
The howlite-resources project has gone through multiple iterations over the years, most of them built with C# and .NET, since that’s my "native tongue" in programming. However, after a short proof of concept, I noticed that Golang handles this kind of application much better in terms of performance, so I decided to take that path.

## React
Currently learning React, mainly to bring myself up to speed with the current state of frontend development. I will continuously push changes to the Stocklify repository as progress is being made.

I also plan to recreate the same applications using Angular, Blazor, and SvelteKit to see how they compare to each other.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on whatever might be interesting
---
Right now, I’d especially love to work with others on building an open-source framework for .NET with a focus on messaging.

🤔 Help with feedback
---
I’d love to hear feedback on howlite-resources from more experienced Golang developers.

💬 Ask me about .NET or C#
---
That’s my turf!
